Music Royalty Management Platform

The MRMP enables the registration of recorded intellectual property in the form of a 
unique ERC721 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Each token represents the legal 
ownership of the instance of IP and contains a reference to an official smart contract.

An application can obtain rights to recordings (i.e. for broadcast purposes) by sending
royalty payments in Ether to the official smart contract referenced in the ERC721 token.
